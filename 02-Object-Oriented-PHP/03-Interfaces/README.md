# Interfaces in PHP

This section demonstrates the use of interfaces in PHP through practical examples. Interfaces define a contract that classes must follow, enabling polymorphism and loose coupling in object-oriented design.

## Topics Covered

1. **Interface Basics**
   - Interface definition
   - Method declarations
   - Implementation requirements
   - Type hinting

2. **Multiple Interfaces**
   - Implementing multiple interfaces
   - Method compatibility
   - Interface inheritance

3. **Interface Segregation**
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Role interfaces
   - Interface composition

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Type hinting with interfaces
   - Runtime type checking
   - Flexible design

5. **Design Patterns**
   - Strategy pattern
   - Observer pattern
   - Factory pattern

## File Structure

- `interfaces.php`: Interactive examples demonstrating interface concepts

## Usage

Open `interfaces.php` in your web browser through a PHP-enabled server to see the examples in action. Each concept is demonstrated with practical examples using geometric shapes.

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding interface contracts
- Implementing multiple interfaces
- Applying interface segregation principle
- Using polymorphism effectively
- Following SOLID principles
